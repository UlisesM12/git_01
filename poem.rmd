Deep into that darkness peering,  
Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,  
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals  
Ever dared to dream before;  
But the silence was unbroken,  
And the stillness gave no token,  
And the only word there spoken  
Was the whispered word, "Lenore!"  
This I whispered, and an echo  
Murmured back the word, "Lenore!"  
Merely this, and nothing more.
